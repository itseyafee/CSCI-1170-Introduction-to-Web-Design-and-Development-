            <h2>Second level heading 1</h2>
            <p>Content paragraph 1. This paragraph is a dummy text paragraph written here in the section named “Second level 
                heading 1”. This is a sample paragraph, which is to be included in a section with an appropriately written heading. 
                This is called content organization using HTML, and the HTML elements you use should be appropriately chosen.

            <h3>Incredible ice creams</h3>
            <p>Let’s now focus on creating paragraphs and lists! Use this content as is but choose appropriate HTML elements to 
                make them appear this way, like an unordered list that follows this paragraph. A list of ice cream flavours:
            <ul>
                <li>Toblerone</li>
                <li>Vanilla</li>
                <li>Strawberry</li>
                <li>Chocolate</li>
                <li>Cookies n’ cream</li>
                <li>Mint chocolate chip</li>
                <li>Cookie dough</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Now here are a few more paragraphs</h3>
            <p>
                The content below is dummy text from <a href="https://forcemipsum.com/">Star Wars ipsum generator, </a><b>include a link (citation) to the Star Wars 
                ipsum generator in the readme file.</b> This is a way for you to get used to using content from external websites, <b>with 
                appropriate citations.</b> Include this content as is, and then write the two paragraphs below.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're 
                doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! 
                Where have you been? They're heading in this direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Try to brace it with something. Wait a minute! Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be? Take 
                over! See to him! Look there! They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch 
                them. Follow me! You stand guard. Come on! Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart 
                here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.
