			<h2>Mos Eisleey Cantina</h2>
			<p>
                <b >Film-</b>
                Dante's View, overlooking Death Valley, was used as 
                the establishing shot for Mos Eisley in Star Wars (1977) 
                Filming location in Ajim, Tunisia for the Mos Eisley 
                Cantina for Star Wars (1977). Mos Eisley made its first 
                appearance in the original 1977 film, Star Wars. It is 
                depicted as a busy, bustling port city situated in a desert 
                plain, populated with transients of all species. The lawless 
                spaceport attracts criminals, smugglers and fugitives.Spacecraft 
                land at docking bays dotted across the city. The Mos Eisley 
                scenes occur early in Star Wars, when the young hero Luke 
                Skywalker and his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi travel to the spaceport 
                in Luke's landspeeder in search of a pilot, accompanied by the 
                droids, C-3PO and R2-D2. Obi-Wan warns Luke that the spaceport 
                may be dangerous. Upon arrival, Luke and Obi-Wan enter the cantina, 
                a dimly-lit tavern patronised by visiting starship pilots. 
                Strong drink is on sale at the bar and there are frequent
                outbreaks of violence among the clientele. The cantina attracts 
                a range of exotic alien species, although droids are not permitted 
                to enter; the bartender orders them to leave, saying "We don't serve 
                their kind in here". A band of domed-headed aliens plays a set of 
                otherworldly jazz-style music.[3][4] Luke is threatened with violence 
                by two of the customers, Ponda Baba, an Aqualish, and Doctor Evazan, 
                a deformed human, but Obi-Wan intervenes with his lightsaber, cutting 
                Ponda's arm off in the fight. This is the first time a lightsaber is 
                used in combat on-screen in the Star Wars franchise. Obi-Wan introduces
                Luke to a pair of smugglers, Chewbacca and Han Solo, and they negotiate 
                terms for passage to the planet Alderaan, which prompts Luke to sell his 
                landspeeder to get the money they need to pay Han. After Luke and Obi-Wan 
                have departed, Han is involved in a brief confrontation with Greedo, a 
                green-skinned gangster; the exchange ends violently when Han shoots 
                first and Greedo dies. As the group prepare to leave, they are followed 
                to Docking Bay 94 by Garindan, a spy working for the Empire. Following a 
                brief gunfight with Imperial stormtroopers, they board the Millennium Falcon 
                spaceship and take off from Tatooine.

                <b >Books-</b>
                In the novelization of the film, Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker 
                by George Lucas (ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster), Mos Eisley is described as a 
                haphazard, run-down settlement built of concrete and sandstone, a large part of it 
                built underground to escape the heat of Tatooine's twin suns.[7] The cantina is 
                described as a dark, sinister bar full of "one-eyed creatures and thousand-eyed, 
                creatures with scales, creatures with fur". The narrative describes "Tentacles, 
                claws and hands... wrapped around drinking utensils". The Expanded Universe anthology 
                of intertwined short stories, Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina, edited by Kevin J. 
                Anderson, explores the cantina and its clientele further. The book names the establishment 
                as "Chalmun's Cantina", introducing its proprietor as a Wookiee named Chalmun; it also 
                reveals that the bartender is named Wuher. The book also explores the reasons for the 
                cantina's ban on droids: the bartender claims to dislike everyone, but lashes out at 
                droids because they are the only thing that will not try to fight back; the proprietor 
                Chalmun does not tolerate droids because they do not drink, and therefore occupy valuable 
                space. The backstory of the cantina's resident swing band is also expanded in the short stories 
                "We Don't Do Weddings: The Band's Tale" by Kathy Tyers and "Empire Blues" by Daniel Keys Moran. 
                The band is named as Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes and it is revealed that the players belong 
                to a race called Bith. Their main musical number is also given a title, "Mad About Me".

                Mos Eisley appears in the 2019 Star Wars television series, The Mandalorian. In "Chapter 5: 
                The Gunslinger", the Mandalorian is forced to set down in Mos Eisley for repairs after a space 
                battle with another bounty hunter. In order to pay for the repairs, the Mandalorian goes to a 
                local cantina to look for a bounty. There, he meets a rookie bounty hunter, Toro Calican, who 
                hires him to help locate Fennec Shand, a dangerous mercenary. The pair locate Shand just beyond 
                the Dune Sea and apprehend her. However, when the Mandalorian goes to retrieve transport for them, 
                Shand tries to turn Calican against him by telling Calican about the Mandalorian turning against the 
                bounty hunter guild to rescue the child. Calican kills Shand and decides to capture the Mandalorian 
                and the child and collect all three bounties. The Mandalorian, however, is able to overcome Calican 
                and rescue the child and Peli, a mechanic that was repairing his ship and watching the child. 
                The Mandalorian gives Peli the reward for Shand as payment for the repairs and he and the child depart 
                Tatooine.
