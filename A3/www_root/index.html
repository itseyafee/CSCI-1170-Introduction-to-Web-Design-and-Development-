            <h3>Few Words about Cantina</h3>
                <p> The Mos Eisley cantina is a dimly-lit tavern known for its strong drinks, hot 
                    tunes, and occasional outbreaks of shocking violence. Most star pilots visiting 
                    Tatooine spend their downtime in the cantina, making it an ideal spot to hire a starship's crew.

                <p>  There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in 
                    this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going? 
                    The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. It will be enough. If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well. What a piece of junk. 
                </p> 
                <p>   
                    She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride s
                    ingle file to hide there numbers. He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. 
                    And he was a good friend. Which reminds me. I have something here for you. Yeah?This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look! Hey, what're you trying to push on 
                    us? Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain. Uncle Owen. Yeah? What about that one? What about that blue one? We'll take that 
                </p>
                <p>
                    one. Yeah, take it away. Mos Eisley made its first appearance in the original 1977 film, Star Wars. It is depicted as a busy, bustling port city situated in a 
                    desert plain, populated with transients of all species. The lawless spaceport attracts criminals, smugglers and fugitives.[2] Spacecraft land at docking bays 
                    dotted across the city. The Mos Eisley scenes occur early in Star Wars, when the young hero Luke Skywalker and his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi travel to the spaceport 
                    in Luke's landspeeder in search of a pilot, accompanied by the droids, C-3PO and R2-D2. Obi-Wan warns Luke that the spaceport may be dangerous. Upon arrival, Luke

                <p>
                    and Obi-Wan enter the cantina, a dimly-lit tavern patronised by visiting starship pilots. Strong drink is on sale at the bar and there are frequent outbreaks of 
                    violence among the clientele. The cantina attracts a range of exotic alien species, although droids are not permitted to enter the bartender orders them to leave, 
                    saying "We don't serve their kind in here". A band of domed-headed aliens plays a set of otherworldly jazz-style music. Luke is threatened with violence by 
                    two of the customers, Ponda Baba, an Aqualish, and Doctor Evazan, a deformed human, but Obi-Wan intervenes with his lightsaber, cutting Ponda's arm off in the fight. 
                    This is the first time a lightsaber is used in combat on-screen in the Star Wars franchise. Obi-Wan introduces Luke to a pair of smugglers, Chewbacca and Han Solo, 
                    and they negotiate terms for passage to the planet Alderaan, which prompts Luke to sell his landspeeder to get the money they need to pay Han. After Luke and Obi-Wan 
                    have departed, Han is involved in a brief confrontation with Greedo, a green-skinned gangster the exchange ends violently when Han shoots first and Greedo dies. 
                    As the group prepare to leave, they are followed to Docking Bay 94 by Garindan, a spy working for the Empire. Following a brief gunfight with Imperial stormtroopers, 
                    they board the Millennium Falcon spaceship and take off from Tatooine.
