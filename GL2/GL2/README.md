## Tasks for this lab exercise
1. Work in a group of 5 -- to be assigned at random during lab time. Other group work or individual work will not be marked and you will get a 0 (zero) on the lab.
2. Each one pick a part/code block in index.html -- there are 5 x code blocks in total.
3. Fix all HTML errors and warnings in the code block that you have chosen.
4. Style them as specified in the reference PDF document. Make assumptions about the colours you are required to use.
5. Use only the CSS float property to make elements appear next to each other.
6. Use margin, padding, border, etc., for spacing elements.
7. Code all your styles in main.css, include a comment that describes who did what styling in CSS -- combine all your style definitions from each member of the group and include all style definitions in main.css. You _*MUST NOT*_ use multiple CSS files.
8. Complete group information and citation information below in this README file.
9. Rename the GL2 folder as GL2_<GroupInitials> -- i.e., replace <GroupInitials> with the first letters of the first names of each member in the group.
10. Save the GL2_<GroupInitials> folder as a .zip compressed folder and submit GL2_<GroupInitials>.zip on Brightspace.
11. Validate your code - both HTML and CSS, save validation PDFs in the folder named validation.
12. Note - each student must submit a copy of this folder, i.e., every student must submit the work done in the group.
