					<p class="featured-text-block">This will begin to make things right. I've traveled too far, and seen too much, to ignore the despair in the galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force. Well, because of you now we have a chance. The General's been after this for a long time. The General. To me, she's royalty.</p>
					<p class="featured-text-block"> My right, your left. Do you see it? Hold on! I see it! Nice shot. Where are you going? We're going back to Jakku. That's where. No no no! We can't go back to Jakku! We need to get outta this system! I got to get to my droid before the First Order does! What - a droid?! That's right. He's a BB unit! Orange and white: one of a kind. I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important! This one is, pal.</p>
					<p class="featured-text-block">He would've disappointed you. --<br> Get out of my head --<br> I know you've seen the map. It's in there... and now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it too.</p>
					<p class="featured-text-block">You already know the truth. Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku, they're never coming back. But... there's someone who still could. Luke. The belonging you seek is not behind you.</p>
					<p class="featured-text-block">What about BB-8? He stays with me -- until I get rid of the gang, then you can have him back and be on your way. What about the Rathtars... where are you keeping them? There's one. What are you gonna do? Same thing I always do: talk my way out of it.</p>

			<p>Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield. The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission.</p>
			<p>Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. Oh... great! Soon you will learn to appreciate me.</p>			
			<p>There goes our surprise attack. Look! Over there! Stop him! Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here.</p>			
			<p>I like Captain Solo where he is. Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite. What could possibly have come over Master Luke.</p>			
			<p>but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.</p>
